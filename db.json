Giving the fig (Old French faire la figue, Spanish dar la higa) was an indecent gesture of ancient provenance, made by putting the thumb between two fingers or into the mouth, with the intended effect of the modern gesture of \\\"flipping the bird\\\" (see bird (n.3)). Also compare sycophant.\\nUse of fig leaf in figurative sense of \\\"flimsy disguise\\\" (1550s) is from Genesis iii.7. Fig-faun translates Latin faunus ficarius (Jeremiah l.39).
